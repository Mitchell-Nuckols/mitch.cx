What's up, I'm Mitchell Nuckols. I am a first year Electrical Engineering major, General Bio minor at the University of California, San Diego.
Currently, my primary interest is in exploring neurotechnologies, focusing on neural interfaces. Apart from my university coursework, I enjoy learning about the neuroengineering field and I hope to attend a graduate program after completing my bachelor's.

Prior to my enrollment at UCSD, I spent time at the College of the Sequoias in Visalia, CA where I completed my math education and began engineering courses for transfer. During this time I was dual enrolled in a high school charter program in order to complete my high school education.
