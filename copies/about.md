## About

What's up, I'm Mitchell Nuckols. I am a first year Electrical Engineering major, General Bio minor at the University of California, San Diego.
Currently, my primary interest is in exploring neurotechnologies, focusing on neural interfaces. Apart from my university coursework, I enjoy learning about neuroscience and I hope to enter a neuroengineering graduate program after completing my bachelor's.

Prior to my enrollment at UCSD, I spent time at the College of the Sequoias in Visalia, CA where I completed my general ed and math education and began engineering courses for transfer. During this time I was dual enrolled in a high school charter program in order to complete my high school education.

This website is meant to serve as a hub for my presence online. I want to use it as a place to share my projects, as well as put myself out there. I figured since it's pretty much impossible to completely hide online, I'd just take up the first couple results on Google - might as well get some use out of it.
