## Projects

Here are some projects I've been working on recently. I often jump from idea to idea, but I'm trying to keep a consistent log of what I'm currently doing.

### [Getting Started with nMigen and the Basys3](/projects/nmigen-basys3)

I've always had an interest in FPGAs. As someone whose original interest in ECE comes from computer architecture/design, the idea of directly manipulating logic on a chip really appeals to me. Recently, I've begun working on my FPGA knowledge through using a Python library called [nMigen](https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen). While I've also been exercising my Verilog skills on the side, I wanted to try an alternative toolchain for designing and synthesizing FPGA implementations. Getting started with nMigen was a challenge at first because there was no board file provided for my Digilent Basys3 development platform - I had to scour through example code to put together my own (work-in-progress) [platform specification](https://github.com/Mitchell-Nuckols/nmigen-basys3).
